# HookKit

An iOS developer framework for unified hooking methods.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

* Improved performance through use of batch hooking (if available).
* Ability to utilize different hooking libraries from your tweak. [Shadow](https://github.com/jjolano/shadow) provides this functionality.

Disadvantages:

* Some library-specific functionality is not implemented (yet)
* Existing tweaks will need to be rewritten/recompiled to use HookKit
